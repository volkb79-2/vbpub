# CIU — Consumers guide: structured worktree control (HOW)

Worked examples for adopting CIU's machine-readable worktree surface. Read
this after [README.md](../README.md) (what) and [DESIGN-GUIDE.md](DESIGN-GUIDE.md)
(why); the normative contract is [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) (§S16.4, §S16.5).

Everything below is copy-paste-able. All examples assume a CIU-managed
worktree family: run `ciu worktree create` first (see below).

## 1. Declare the config a consumer needs (valid TOML)

A consumer project declares the ordinary global configuration that this
surface reads:

```toml
[ciu.worktree]
max_concurrent_instances = 3

[deploy]
project_name = "myapp"
environment_tag = "dev"
network_name = "$DOCKER_NETWORK_INTERNAL"
landscape_id = "prod-eu"
```

`landscape_id` is opt-in [S3.11](SPEC.md#s3--configuration-model): a
DNS-label-safe slug (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`) that a consumer renders its
Consul KV root (`dstdns/<landscape_id>/…`) and mesh ACL tags from.

## 2. Create a managed instance and read its lifecycle JSON

```console
$ ciu worktree create pkg-under-test --prefix myapp --feature pkg-under-test --json
{"schema_version": 1, "operation": "create", "status": "ready", "instance": {...}}
```

Every lifecycle verb (`create`, `ensure`, `adopt`, `add`) with `--json` emits
the same envelope. `status` is one of `allocating`, `ready`,
`recovery-required`; a `recovery-required` instance carries a closed
`recovery_status` of `checkout-incomplete`, `env-generation-failed`, or
`runtime-collision`. Resume a partial allocation with `ensure`.

## 3. Inspect one instance with fresh Git facts

```console
$ ciu worktree inspect pkg-under-test --json
{"schema_version": 1, "operation": "inspect", "status": "ready",
 "instance": {...}, "git": {"registered": true, "path": "...",
 "branch": "myapp-...", "detached": false, "primary": false,
 "head": "abc12345", "dirty": false}}
```

`git.*` is freshly read from Git, never inferred from the record. A record
whose checkout is gone, a branch mismatch, a duplicate logical identity, or
an unreadable `git status` is a refusal on stderr with exit 2 — never a
guessed value. `dirty` is true when `git status --porcelain` is non-empty.

## 4. List every managed instance

```console
$ ciu worktree list --json
{"schema_version": 1, "operation": "list", "status": "ready",
 "instances": [{"operation": "inspect", "status": "ready", "instance": {...},
 "git": {...}}]}
```

The prose `ciu worktree list` still shows every git worktree; `--json` shows
only managed instances, each with fresh Git facts.

## 5. Remove and read the removal document

```console
$ ciu worktree rm pkg-under-test --json
{"schema_version": 1, "operation": "remove", "status": "removed",
 "removed_path": "...", "instance": {...}}
```

`rm` runs `ciu clean` then `git worktree remove` (that order is normative,
[SPEC §S16](SPEC.md#s16--worktree-instances-ciu-worktree)). A failed clean or
git removal raises with exit 2 and **no** success document; the error names
the retained resources.

## 6. Discover capabilities instead of guessing from the version

```console
$ ciu capabilities --json
{"schema_version": 1, "capabilities": ["worktree.identity.v1",
 "worktree.inspect.v1", "worktree.lifecycle-json.v1"]}
```

Allowlist the identifiers you depend on. `worktree.up`/`exec` identifiers are
intentionally absent until their packages ship — do not infer them.

## Failure vocabulary, one place

`allocating` — allocation in progress; `ready` — a complete, closed runtime
identity; `recovery-required` — an interrupted allocation with a closed
`recovery_status`; `removed` — the terminal removal state. Every JSON document
carries `schema_version: 1` and a closed `operation`. Unknown shapes fail
fast.
