"""handoffd: resident reconciler + read-only HTTP/SSE surface. PACKAGE P09.

Residency is an optimization, never an authority: every pass rebuilds its
snapshot FROM DISK, so kill -9 on the daemon loses nothing (deciding log
2026-07-15). Wrappers are detached and keep running across daemon restarts.

INTERFACE CONTRACT (frozen):

- Daemon(registry: dict[str, Path]) — one daemon supervises all registered
  projects (config.load_registry()).
- run():
    * write pidfile paths.daemon_dir()/handoffd.pid (refuse to start if an
      existing pidfile's pid is alive); append DAEMON_STARTED per project.
    * loop until SIGTERM/SIGINT: for each project run_pass(project), then
      sleep min(reconcile_interval_seconds over projects) — a plain
      time.sleep loop in the main thread is acceptable (no asyncio needed;
      the HTTP server runs in its own thread).
    * on shutdown: append DAEMON_STOPPED per project, remove pidfile. Never
      kill wrappers on shutdown.
- run_pass(project) — ONE reconcile pass, also the body of `tick --once`:
    1. Build ReconcileInput from disk:
       states=storage.list_states, frontmatters/lint via frontmatter+lint
       modules (lint_clean = not lint.has_blocking), decisions_open from
       decisions.parse_inbox, merged_branches from
       `git -C root branch --merged <default_branch>` plus branches whose
       task statefile is MERGED+, leases_free via leases.holder_info,
       provider_ok via adapters.probe MEMOIZED for probe_ttl_seconds (600)
       in daemon memory (a restart just re-probes), log_quiet_seconds /
       pid_alive / receipts by scanning attempt dirs of non-terminal
       attempts, stall_confirmed from _confirm_stall() (tier 2: pid alive
       AND log quiet AND /proc/<pid>/stat unchanged CPU over two passes —
       keep the two-pass cache in daemon memory), budget_remaining from
       policy.max_cost minus summed attempt usage costs (same currency
       only), merge_history/carve_outcomes/rejections from recent events
       (iter_events tail).
    2. actions = reconcile.plan_project(inp)
    3. execute(project, action) for each — see EXECUTION MAP below.
    4. render.render_all(...) if any event was appended this pass.
    5. Wrap the whole pass in try/except: append TICK_ERROR (bounded repr)
       and continue — one project's failure never stops the loop.
- EXECUTION MAP (all storage writes via append_and_apply, actor
  Actor(TICK, 'handoffd')):
    CreateTask -> TASK_CREATED (statefile CARVED, handoff_path set)
    Transition -> TASK_TRANSITIONED (payload from/to/notes)
    DispatchImplementer -> create worktree if missing (git worktree add -b
      feat/<task_id> <worktree_root>/feat/<task_id> <default_branch>; if
      branch exists, add without -b), build Attempt record (types.new_id
      ('att'), role IMPLEMENTER, state CREATED, route snapshot with
      routes_rev), ATTEMPT_CREATED; adapters.build_dispatch ->
      WrapperSpec -> wrapper.launch_detached; ATTEMPT_PREFLIGHTED (state
      PREFLIGHTING, pid=wrapper pid). Task ACTIVE via Transition.
    ResumeAttempt -> adapters.build_resume argv -> new WrapperSpec into the
      SAME attempt dir (suffix .resume-N) -> launch; ATTEMPT_RESUMED
      (state RUNNING).
    InterruptAttempt -> SIGTERM to attempt pgid (from child.pid; ESRCH is
      fine); the WRAPPER emits the interrupted event, not the daemon.
    MarkInterrupted -> ATTEMPT_INTERRUPTED (state INTERRUPTED, ended=now).
    StallCheck -> feed _confirm_stall cache only (no event).
    EmitAttemptExit -> no-op safeguard (wrapper normally emits); if the
      wrapper died before writing its event but receipt.json exists, emit
      ATTEMPT_EXITED from the receipt here, then task transition per
      reconcile contract item 4.
    ProviderPause -> PROVIDER_STATE_CHANGED {route_id, state:'limited'};
      daemon memory marks provider_ok[route_id]=False for
      provider_pause_seconds (3600) — and NEEDS_OPERATOR notification.
    OpenWave -> WAVE_OPENED (wave_id=new_id('wave'), task_ids).
    LaunchReview -> assemble packet dir under attempts dir of a synthetic
      review attempt: per task, `git -C root diff <default_branch>...HEAD`
      of its branch dumped to <packet>/<task_id>.diff + --stat + handoff/
      report paths list in packet.md; create Attempt (role FRONTIER_REVIEW,
      route = first route of tier 'frontier-review'), dispatch via wrapper
      like an implementer with the packet path in the prompt.
    SpecAttention -> SPEC_ATTENTION event.
    After every event append: notify.notify_event(cfg, states, ev).
- HTTP (loopback only, port = min over projects' policy.http_port):
  thread with http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer.
    GET /                    -> 302 /www/index.html
    GET /www/<path>          -> serve paths.www_dir() files (no traversal:
                                resolve() must stay under www_dir)
    GET /api/projects        -> registry summary JSON
    GET /api/tasks?project=  -> [statefile dicts]
    GET /api/task/<project>/<task_id> -> statefile dict
    GET /api/events?project=&since=   -> [event dicts] (cap 500)
    GET /api/log/<project>/<attempt_id>?tail=65536 -> text/plain, LAST n
        bytes of the attempt log passed through cfg.redact
    GET /api/stream?project= -> text/event-stream: poll events.jsonl every
        2s, emit new events as `data: <json>\n\n` (heartbeat comment line
        every 15s); connection ends when client disconnects.
  All responses read-only; no mutation endpoints exist.
- stop(): set the loop flag false and shut the HTTP server down (used by
  tests; signal handlers call it).
