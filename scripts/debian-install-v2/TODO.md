# debian-install-v2 — TODO / backlog

## Feature request: a zswap fill-watermark governor

There is no kernel-native way to keep the zswap compressed pool hovering
around a target fill level (e.g. "~80%, evict the excess to disk, but never
fully drain any one cgroup's pool"). The three runtime knobs under
`/sys/module/zswap/parameters/` are the entire menu, and none of them do
this:

- `max_pool_percent` — a hard ceiling on pool size, not a target.
- `accept_threshold_percent` — only matters *after* the ceiling is already
  hit; decides when to resume accepting pages, not a general fill target.
- `shrinker_enabled` — a generic, kernel-pressure-driven, cross-memcg LRU
  shrinker with no per-cgroup floor and no target percentage.

Confirmed live, twice, on the gstammtisch game host (2026-09-08, soulmask
periodic-stall investigation): enabling `shrinker_enabled` under real memory
pressure does not trim proportionally — it fully evacuates whichever
cgroup's pool it currently judges coldest, down to **0%**, with no
in-between state, and it does not recover on its own once off. First
occurrence drained one Soulmask instance's ~650-680M pool to 0 over ~7
minutes with the sibling instance untouched; re-enabled later to see if the
untouched instance would eventually go the same way, it drained a much
larger ~2.7G pool to 0 in **~2.5 minutes**, this time with a directly
observed severe stall (in-game FPS crashed to 8.3, disk-refault rate peaked
past 45,000/s). Turning `shrinker_enabled` back off stops the drain
immediately but does not restore what already moved to disk. Full
measurement detail: `scripts/gstammtisch-guide/OBSERVATION.md` §1.

**Ask:** a small userspace watcher/governor — poll
`/sys/kernel/debug/zswap/pool_total_size` (or the per-cgroup
`memory.zswap.current` for the specific cgroups that matter) against a
configured target band (e.g. 70-85% of the `max_pool_percent` ceiling), and
toggle `shrinker_enabled` on just long enough to trim back into the band,
then off again — instead of leaving it either permanently off (pool bursts
straight to disk once full, the original problem) or permanently on
(runaway full drain, the newly-discovered problem). This is host-tuning
scope, not game-specific, hence filed here rather than in gstammtisch-guide
— natural home given `debian_install_v2/README.md` §"Host tuning
(incorporated from gstammtisch-guide)" already owns `vm_swappiness`/KSM/oomd
config the same way.

Not designed or scoped beyond the above; no code exists yet.

_Captured 2026-09-08 from the live gstammtisch soulmask-stall investigation;
filed by Claude per operator request. debian-install-v2 has no CHANGES.md or
managed nyxloom backlog yet (checked `nyxloom.toml` for `[backlog_entries]`
— absent), so this file is the tracker, mirroring the same convention used
in `modern-debian-tools-python-debug/TODO.md` for the host-escape-helper
request filed earlier the same session._

## Feature request: adopt nyxloom's Mattermost notification pattern (not the package itself)

Operator asked (2026-09-08, netcup live-test session) whether the scp-api/
debian-install-v2 tooling could adopt nyxloom's Telegram/Mattermost
notification adapter (`nyxloom/src/nyxloom/notify.py`) instead of
maintaining its own separate Telegram-only sender, since nyxloom now has a
running Mattermost stack on main (`nyxloom/mattermost/`).

**Investigated. Findings:**

- `notify.py` is NOT a generic, importable library — it's nyxloom's own P06
  package, ~800 lines, tightly coupled to nyxloom's typed `Event`/
  `EventType`/`NotifyConfig` model plus its `storage`/`snapshot`/`log`
  modules (`from . import snapshot, storage`). Importing it would drag in
  most of nyxloom's core, not a small utility.
- Notably, nyxloom itself does **not** have a Telegram backend yet either —
  only `NtfyBackend`, the legacy `WebhookBackend`, and the new
  `MattermostBackend` are implemented (`notify.py`'s own docstring: "Telegram/
  Discord are additional subclasses later").
- What IS genuinely small and reusable: `mattermost_payload()` — folds a
  `{title, body, click, priority, tags}` note into Mattermost's incoming-
  webhook `{"text": ...}` contract (Mattermost ignores every other key),
  with priority folded into a fixed `:rotating_light:`/`:warning:` Markdown
  prefix since incoming webhooks have no real priority field. ~25 lines,
  zero third-party dependencies.
- **Why not import nyxloom as a dependency**: both `scp-api-install-host.py`
  and `debian-install-v2/bootstrap-remote.py` are deliberately single-file,
  dependency-free scripts — `bootstrap-remote.py` in particular runs via
  `curl | python3 -` on a freshly-imaged host with zero pip packages
  available, so pulling in a whole separate product's package there is a
  non-starter. (Same reasoning already applied the same session when
  `scp-api-install-host.py`'s `_load_env_file`/`_write_env_file` were
  duplicated rather than imported from the sibling `telegram_setup.py`.)
- **Where the real integration point is**: `debian_install_v2/installer.py`
  already has its own hand-rolled Telegram sender (`_split_for_telegram`,
  direct `api.telegram.org` calls) tightly coupled to
  `Config.telegram_bot_token`/`telegram_chat_id`/`telegram_verbose_progress`/
  `telegram_thread_id` and its own credential-file plumbing (systemd
  `LoadCredential`, `/etc/vbpub/credentials/telegram_*`).
  `scp-api-install-host.py` itself sends no notifications directly — it only
  passes `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`/`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` through into the
  customScript for `debian_install_v2` to use on the host.

**Recommendation:** borrow the pattern, don't import the package. Port a
small, adapted Mattermost-payload translator into `installer.py`, and
generalize its currently Telegram-only notifier into a pluggable backend
(new `Config` field, e.g. `notify_backend`/`webhook_url`, selecting
Telegram vs. Mattermost) — mirroring nyxloom's `NotifyBackend` shape without
depending on nyxloom itself. This is real, moderate-scope work (new Config
field(s), a new backend class, credential-file handling for a webhook URL
instead of bot-token/chat-id, a new customScript env var, tests) — scoping
it as its own follow-on task rather than folding it into the in-flight
live-test session, which is using the existing Telegram sender unchanged
for this round.

Not designed or scoped beyond the above; no code written yet.
