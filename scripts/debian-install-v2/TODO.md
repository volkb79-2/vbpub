# debian-install-v2 — TODO / backlog

## Feature request: a zswap fill-watermark governor

There is no kernel-native way to keep the zswap compressed pool hovering
around a target fill level (e.g. "~80%, evict the excess to disk, but never
fully drain any one cgroup's pool"). The three runtime knobs under
`/sys/module/zswap/parameters/` are the entire menu, and none of them do
this:

- `max_pool_percent` — a hard ceiling on pool size, not a target.
- `accept_threshold_percent` — only matters *after* the ceiling is already
  hit; decides when to resume accepting pages, not a general fill target.
- `shrinker_enabled` — a generic, kernel-pressure-driven, cross-memcg LRU
  shrinker with no per-cgroup floor and no target percentage.

Confirmed live, twice, on the gstammtisch game host (2026-09-08, soulmask
periodic-stall investigation): enabling `shrinker_enabled` under real memory
pressure does not trim proportionally — it fully evacuates whichever
cgroup's pool it currently judges coldest, down to **0%**, with no
in-between state, and it does not recover on its own once off. First
occurrence drained one Soulmask instance's ~650-680M pool to 0 over ~7
minutes with the sibling instance untouched; re-enabled later to see if the
untouched instance would eventually go the same way, it drained a much
larger ~2.7G pool to 0 in **~2.5 minutes**, this time with a directly
observed severe stall (in-game FPS crashed to 8.3, disk-refault rate peaked
past 45,000/s). Turning `shrinker_enabled` back off stops the drain
immediately but does not restore what already moved to disk. Full
measurement detail: `scripts/gstammtisch-guide/OBSERVATION.md` §1.

**Ask:** a small userspace watcher/governor — poll
`/sys/kernel/debug/zswap/pool_total_size` (or the per-cgroup
`memory.zswap.current` for the specific cgroups that matter) against a
configured target band (e.g. 70-85% of the `max_pool_percent` ceiling), and
toggle `shrinker_enabled` on just long enough to trim back into the band,
then off again — instead of leaving it either permanently off (pool bursts
straight to disk once full, the original problem) or permanently on
(runaway full drain, the newly-discovered problem). This is host-tuning
scope, not game-specific, hence filed here rather than in gstammtisch-guide
— natural home given `debian_install_v2/README.md` §"Host tuning
(incorporated from gstammtisch-guide)" already owns `vm_swappiness`/KSM/oomd
config the same way.

Not designed or scoped beyond the above; no code exists yet.

_Captured 2026-09-08 from the live gstammtisch soulmask-stall investigation;
filed by Claude per operator request. debian-install-v2 has no CHANGES.md or
managed nyxloom backlog yet (checked `nyxloom.toml` for `[backlog_entries]`
— absent), so this file is the tracker, mirroring the same convention used
in `modern-debian-tools-python-debug/TODO.md` for the host-escape-helper
request filed earlier the same session._
