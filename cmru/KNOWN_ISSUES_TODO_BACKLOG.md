# CMRU — Known Issues, TODO & Backlog

## Known Issues

### KI-01 — GHCR package visibility cannot be set via API (platform limitation) — *worked around*
**Status:** worked around (cmru no longer fails the release); full automation is upstream-blocked.
**SPEC:** `S4.7` (amended MUST → best-effort).
**Symptom:** `cmru release` for an OCI project (mdt, pwmcp) pushed the image fine but then aborted with
`[ERROR] set GHCR package visibility … HTTP 404`, failing the whole release after a successful push.
**Root cause (verified 2026-06-21):** GitHub exposes **no REST or GraphQL API** to change a container
package's visibility. `PATCH …/users/<owner>/packages/container/<name>` **and** `…/user/packages/
container/<name>` both return `404` — the route does not exist (not a permission mask). Classic PATs have
**no `admin:packages`** scope (only `read:`/`write:`/`delete:packages`); **fine-grained PATs cannot use
the Packages API at all** ([github/roadmap#558](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/558)). So **no
token of any kind** can do this programmatically.
**Fix shipped:** `cmru/src/cmru/ghcr.py` now raises a typed `PackageVisibilityApiUnsupported`;
`mirror_package_visibility` catches it and logs a **non-fatal `[WARN]`** with the one-time UI remediation,
then returns the current visibility. A successful image push no longer fails the release on visibility.
**Operator action (one-time per package):** *Your packages → `<pkg>` → Package settings → Danger Zone →
Change visibility → Public*. Visibility **persists across all future pushes**, so it is never repeated.
**Re-check upstream:** if fine-grained PATs gain Packages API support (roadmap#558), or GitHub adds a
visibility endpoint, restore fully-automatic sync and re-tighten `S4.7` to MUST.
