# run-gate RG-55 wave (lane resource profiling) — controller log

Plan of record: `run-gate-project/nyxloom-trove/WAVE-PLAN-2026-09-12-rg55-profiling.md`.
Contract (frozen by the P0 package below): `run-gate-project/nyxloom-trove/RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`
(mirrored verbatim at `scripts/cgroup-profiler/docs/RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`).
Rulings are numbered `RW-n` from `RW-1` for this wave and bind both P1 and
P2; a contract change after dispatch is always a new numbered ruling here,
never a silent edit to the contract file.

## Rulings

- **RW-1 (2026-09-12):** P1 (cgroup-profiler daemon) and P2 (run-gate
  client) are dispatched IN PARALLEL, per plan D-13 — the operator's
  explicit choice in the 2026-09-12 interview ("contract first, two
  parallel packages, then integration"). This supersedes, for this wave
  only, the 2026-09-03 "single agent, single gate" serial dispatch
  directive recorded in the `dispatch` skill. It does NOT relax the
  estate's standing host-load rules: the gate-container cap (at most 2
  across the estate, 3 CPUs each, `docker update --cpus=3` right after
  launch) and "one measurement probe at a time with the daemon idle" still
  bind both packages exactly as the plan's §7 HOST LOAD block states.

- **RW-2:** bare-host lanes are explicitly out of v1 scope (plan D-5) →
  filed as **RG-57** (`run-gate-project/KNOWN_ISSUES_TODO_BACKLOG.md`).
  Conjunction lanes record nothing of their own (plan §3.1) — each member
  lane's own profiling record is the only one that exists; the conjunction
  wrapper itself never gets a `resources` field.

- **RW-3:** the uncommitted one-line fix at
  `scripts/cgroup-profiler/cgprofile.py:685` (`cmd_targets`'s helper spec
  must use `DEFAULT_OUT`, not `HERE`) belongs to another session and stays
  UNCOMMITTED in the shared checkout — this P0 package does not touch it,
  per the "never clobber another session's uncommitted work" rule. P1
  re-applies the identical one-line fix as its own first commit inside its
  own worktree (`.worktrees/rg55-profiler-daemon`); if the original owner
  commits it to `main` first, a later merge of P1's branch resolves
  identically (the same one-line change either way) and is not a conflict
  worth avoiding in advance.

- **RW-4:** the contract is FROZEN at the P0 commit hash
  **`63b928da0770c79409f8ad5faff0b840a6e0cf30`** (`vbpub@63b928da`; this
  line was updated by a second, tiny commit immediately after the P0
  commit landed — the hash could not be known before committing). Any change
  to the contract after this point is a new numbered ruling here, delivered
  to both implementers; nobody edits `RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`
  unilaterally.

## Dispatch

| package | worktree | branch | implementer | reviewer | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 — cgroup-profiler daemon | `.worktrees/rg55-profiler-daemon` | `rg55-profiler-daemon` | fresh Sonnet (checkpoint clause on) | fresh Opus xhigh (never a fork) | pending dispatch |
| P2 — run-gate client | `.worktrees/rg55-run-gate-client` | `rg55-run-gate-client` | fresh Sonnet (checkpoint clause on) | fresh Opus xhigh (never a fork) | pending dispatch |
