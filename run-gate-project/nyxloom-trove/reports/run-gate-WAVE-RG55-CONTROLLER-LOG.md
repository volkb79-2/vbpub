# run-gate RG-55 wave (lane resource profiling) — controller log

Plan of record: `run-gate-project/nyxloom-trove/WAVE-PLAN-2026-09-12-rg55-profiling.md`.
Contract (frozen by the P0 package below): `run-gate-project/nyxloom-trove/RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`
(mirrored verbatim at `scripts/cgroup-profiler/docs/RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`).
Rulings are numbered `RW-n` from `RW-1` for this wave and bind both P1 and
P2; a contract change after dispatch is always a new numbered ruling here,
never a silent edit to the contract file.

## Rulings

- **RW-1 (2026-09-12):** P1 (cgroup-profiler daemon) and P2 (run-gate
  client) are dispatched IN PARALLEL, per plan D-13 — the operator's
  explicit choice in the 2026-09-12 interview ("contract first, two
  parallel packages, then integration"). This supersedes, for this wave
  only, the 2026-09-03 "single agent, single gate" serial dispatch
  directive recorded in the `dispatch` skill. It does NOT relax the
  estate's standing host-load rules: the gate-container cap (at most 2
  across the estate, 3 CPUs each, `docker update --cpus=3` right after
  launch) and "one measurement probe at a time with the daemon idle" still
  bind both packages exactly as the plan's §7 HOST LOAD block states.

- **RW-2:** bare-host lanes are explicitly out of v1 scope (plan D-5) →
  filed as **RG-57** (`run-gate-project/KNOWN_ISSUES_TODO_BACKLOG.md`).
  Conjunction lanes record nothing of their own (plan §3.1) — each member
  lane's own profiling record is the only one that exists; the conjunction
  wrapper itself never gets a `resources` field.

- **RW-3:** the uncommitted one-line fix at
  `scripts/cgroup-profiler/cgprofile.py:685` (`cmd_targets`'s helper spec
  must use `DEFAULT_OUT`, not `HERE`) belongs to another session and stays
  UNCOMMITTED in the shared checkout — this P0 package does not touch it,
  per the "never clobber another session's uncommitted work" rule. P1
  re-applies the identical one-line fix as its own first commit inside its
  own worktree (`.worktrees/rg55-profiler-daemon`); if the original owner
  commits it to `main` first, a later merge of P1's branch resolves
  identically (the same one-line change either way) and is not a conflict
  worth avoiding in advance.

- **RW-4:** the contract is FROZEN at the P0 commit hash
  **`63b928da0770c79409f8ad5faff0b840a6e0cf30`** (`vbpub@63b928da`; this
  line was updated by a second, tiny commit immediately after the P0
  commit landed — the hash could not be known before committing). Any change
  to the contract after this point is a new numbered ruling here, delivered
  to both implementers; nobody edits `RG55-INTERFACE-CONTRACT.md`
  unilaterally.

- **RW-5 (P2, after its first checkpoint):** 0/0 diff semantics corrected.
  As first landed (`607950fd`), a `changed_executable == 0` verdict REFUSED
  (exit 2) unless `--allow-empty-diff` — which makes `./run-gate.py
  selftest` red on `main` itself (merge-base(main, HEAD) == HEAD → zero
  changed lines) and would block every `cmru release` of this project. Now:
  0/0 → exit 0 with a distinct verdict line `diff-coverage SKIPPED: 0
  changed executable lines under '<source>' between <base> and HEAD
  (<relation>)` and `"verdict": "skipped"` in any structured output, never
  `100.0% OK`; refusal is OPT-IN via `--refuse-empty-diff` (the
  `--allow-empty-diff` flag is removed). Rationale: the false-green hazard
  RG-51/RG-54 describe is a WRONG BASE hiding real source changes; the judge
  cannot tell that from "this change has no source lines" by the zero alone,
  so the zero is made visible and named, and the wrong-base guard stays
  RG-51's fork-point rule. Landed as `8c76ba3e`.
- **RW-6:** accepted P2's reading — `branches_total`/`branches_missed` are
  scoped to the changed-line set and reported beside the line counts.
- **RW-7:** accepted P1's reading — "the last read of `memory.peak` /
  `pids.peak`" (contract §7) means the last SUCCESSFUL read (skip back over
  trailing nulls), pinned by a dedicated test in `lib/summary.py`'s suite.
- **RW-8 (P2 C2):** assay judge scope for run-gate-project's new lanes:
  `judge.source_roots = ["."]` with `base_source = "request"`; `tests/` is
  excluded by assay's own `is_test_path`; `tools/` IS judged deliberately (a
  changed line in `tools/coverage_gate.py` must be covered by
  `tests/test_coverage_gate.py` — that is what 100% on every changed line
  means here). No restructuring of `run-gate.py` into a subdirectory.
  Narrowest supported exclusion only if the symlink/fixtures trip the
  adapter; never exclude `tools/`.
- **RW-9 (process):** a decision ask never stops a package — record it,
  apply the reading the handoff/contract/fixtures imply, mark it, continue
  with everything independent of it. (P2's second session stopped on the
  C2 ask with C3–C8 untouched.)

- **RW-10 (P2 C2):** accepted P2's readings — the `assay-r3` canary runs the
  one pytest selector that encodes the invariant (the cgroup-profiler
  `canary-run.sh` shape, not the full r1 argv on a scratch copy), and
  `assay plan r2` stood in for the RW-8 proof because `assay plan` is
  R2-only. assay-r1's first run on the branch FAILED (86.9%) on a real gap
  in `tools/coverage_gate.py` invisible to the narrower selftest — closed
  with four tests (`45f2aa5a`); the lane is doing its job.
- **RW-11 (contract amendment, P2 C3):** contract §4.3's basic-path file
  list gains `memory.max` and `memory.high` (12 files): §7's `limit_drift`
  and the golden `summary-basic-v1.json` both require them. Applies to the
  daemon side as a no-op (it samples every group already). The contract
  file itself (and its mirror) is amended at P3 integration so both copies
  move in lockstep; until then this ruling is the text.
- **RW-12 (P2 C3 wiring):** `await_container` tick shape — no background
  sampler thread. `proc.wait(timeout=tick)` with `tick =
  PROFILE_SAMPLE_SECONDS` while a basic sampler is active, else
  `PROGRESS_POLL_SECONDS`; the progress/log-stream watch polls only when
  ≥ `PROGRESS_POLL_SECONDS` have elapsed since its last poll (monotonic,
  injectable), so RG-36/RG-41 stall semantics are unchanged. The daemon
  path does no per-tick work and no `ctl status` polling in v1.

## Dispatch

| package | worktree | branch | implementer | reviewer | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 — cgroup-profiler daemon | `.worktrees/rg55-profiler-daemon` | `rg55-profiler-daemon` | fresh Sonnet (checkpoint clause on) | fresh Opus xhigh (never a fork) | session 1 → C0+C1 (`bc47130d`); session 2 dispatched for C2–C9 |
| P2 — run-gate client | `.worktrees/rg55-run-gate-client` | `rg55-run-gate-client` | fresh Sonnet (checkpoint clause on) | fresh Opus xhigh (never a fork) | session 1 → C1 (`1dc201ab`); session 2 → RW-5 rework + pyz vendored (`554d1a1a`); session 3 dispatched for C2 rest + C3–C8 |
