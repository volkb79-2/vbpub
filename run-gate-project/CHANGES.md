# Changelog — run-gate

All notable changes to `run-gate.py` and its estate adoption are recorded
here. The in-file `__revision__` is the drift marker: estate sweeps compare
it, and any consumer holding a COPY (not a symlink) must re-copy when it
moves. Normative behavior lives in SPEC.md; entry-by-entry rationale lives in
KNOWN_ISSUES_TODO_BACKLOG.md and git history.

## [Unreleased]
<!-- hand-written ahead of release; cmru's generator will produce the real dated entry for this range at release time -->

### Fixed
- **RG-24 — exec-mode container resolution is worktree-scoped (rev 24).**
  `resolve_container_name()` now prefers the JUDGED worktree's own
  `ciu.global.toml` over the shared-`.git`-owning repo's, falling back to the
  repo's unchanged when the worktree has none. A multi-instance ("Mode-B")
  worktree with its own rendered config, network and runner used to have its
  lane exec'd into the MAIN checkout's container — a partial, believable
  failure (the inner `cd` still found the right files; only the container's
  baked network/env were wrong). The pre-execution disclosure now names the
  resolution scope (`judged worktree:` / `repo:`) and the file used, and a
  missing-config refusal names both candidate paths. SPEC `R-14a`;
  CONSUMERS "Python app estate with its own runner".

<!-- Post-release housekeeping (assay CHANGES.md precedent): this block is
     CLEARED immediately after a release. cmru generates the dated entry
     below from the commit range but does NOT clear this hand-written block
     itself — leaving content here would republish shipped work as
     "unreleased" on the next cycle. -->

### Added
- feat(run-gate): adopt estate release orchestration with a diff-coverage floor (b6ec5d6a)

### Fixed
- fix(run-gate): resolve adversarial-review findings on the release-adoption program (db173082)
- fix(run-gate): run the selftest lane in host mode, not tester-unified (ca023b78)
- fix(run-gate): scope the selftest diff-coverage floor to run-gate.py alone (1c1d2fda)
- fix(run-gate): RG-22 — safe.directory global-config write survives pre-existing entries (9ad6388f)

### Changed
- backlog(run-gate): RG-22 — safe.directory overwrite fails when global config has multiple entries (2174d22e)

## [22] - 2026-08-24 — RG-sweep program complete

Backlog entries RG-1..RG-20 implemented (RG-18 excepted — dstdns-side scope,
see its backlog body), adversarially reviewed by two independent fresh
reviewers (findings fixed in rev 21–22 commits), then verified end-to-end.
Merged to main as `vbpub@91df32ee` (--no-ff, no conflicts).

### Rev map (one backlog item each unless noted)
- rev 4 RG-15 — assay lanes execute in the selected worktree
- rev 5 RG-11 — reserved exit codes: 2 config/refusal, 3 infrastructure
- rev 6 RG-4 — pins.version actually checked (whole-token grammar)
- rev 7 RG-16 — central configs may define shared lanes
- rev 8 RG-3 — dual-mount degeneracy fix
- rev 9 RG-5 — `{worktree}` substitution hardened (quoting/injection)
- rev 10 RG-6 — exec-mode refusal names the project-agnostic remedy
- rev 11 RG-17/RG-19 — required_env preflight + forwarding log + --check-env
- rev 12 RG-1 — conjunction override guard (`--worktree`/`--allow-dirty`)
- rev 13 RG-12 — failing-container evidence preserved (mode 0600)
- rev 14 RG-10 — artifacts key + unconditional verdict/evidence disclosure
- rev 15 RG-2 — `validate-pointers` verb + estate linkage meta-tests
- rev 16 RG-8 — `--dry-run` plan rehearsal on all three runners
- rev 17 RG-20 — resource-aware admission (slice budget from cgroupfs,
  shared-infra locks, lane `resources` key)
- rev 18 RG-9 — `doctor` preflight verb
- rev 19 RG-14 — wheel as second artifact (version derived from __revision__)
- rev 20 RG-13 — docs sweep + estate adoption retro ×9 projects
- rev 21–22 — adversarial-review hardening (SPEC header Rev 5 lists the
  rule-level deltas R-02..R-32)

### Verification ledger (2026-08-24, phase B/C)
- Suite: `pytest tests -q` → **205 passed** on the branch pre-merge and again
  on shared main post-merge.
- `--list`: all 9 consuming projects, rc=0.
- Every declared lane executed end-to-end (16 total): mdt/smoke, plesk/smoke,
  topos/py-compile, topos/topos-suite (2922 passed, diff-coverage 100% floor),
  pwmcp/tests (8 passed), nyxloom/tester-unified (diff-coverage 100% floor),
  srdm/unit, srdm/e2e (full systemd suite), ciu/ciu, cmru/{assay, coverage
  (1675 passed, 100%), canary, mutation, gate}.
- Assay judgment read SEPARATELY from each verdict artifact (LESSONS L4):
  assay claims R0–R3 PASS; ciu claims R0–R1 PASS (its declared rigor);
  cmru claim R0 PASS.
- cmru/gate conjunction rc=0 with every sub-invocation carrying explicit
  `--worktree {worktree}` — RG-1's guard exercised against a real daemon.
- cmru/mutation took its honest self-skip path (no changed src since
  cmru-v5.0.0), proving the KI-18 base-resolution contract.
- srdm/coverage **fails from a linked worktree** (covergate git plumbing hits
  the main checkout's gitdir, which gate.sh's single-subtree mount does not
  carry) and **passes on main** — environment topology, not a run-gate defect;
  run-gate's own exit-status passthrough and clean-tree refusal behaved
  correctly throughout. Filed as RG-21 with candidate directions.
- Merge held one foreign uncommitted edit (ciu/docs CIU-V7 proposal notes)
  via tagged stash round-trip; restored untouched afterwards.

### Re-copy obligation (drift marker = 22)
All nine in-repo consumers invoke `../run-gate-project/run-gate.py` through a
SYMLINK — zero re-copies owed inside vbpub. Any out-of-repo COPY of an older
revision (none known today) must re-copy before its next gate run.
